Massive Online Open Courses J2EE Project

1. Motivation
This document summarizes the targeted platform requirements.

2. What is a course?
It is a structured aggregation of video recordings (lectures), reading course materials,
assignments, quizzes and exams, in a specific thematic. It has prerequisites and learning
outcomes that should be clearly stated. A course is set on at least three weeks. Its
resources appear gradually for learners on a preset chronology.

3. Platform users
Trainers, Universities, Learners and Committee members…
The Trainer can basically submit a course. He can also update its content and structure
at any time according to the feedback of different users of the platform. The trainer also
keeps an eye on assignments and quizzes results of the learners following his courses.
The trainer can submit s course in his own name or under the auspices of an authorized
University.
A Learner can voluntarily enroll in order to follow a course. By doing so, he will have
access to course lectures, quizzes and examination. He will granted access to discussion
space where he can collaborate with other learners and even ask live questions to the
Trainer. He will earn badges for the advancements he makes. And if he succeeds in the
final examination, he will be delivered a certificate of achievement. A Learner is also
asked for feedback. In fact, he can respond to surveys aimed at improving the services
offered by the platform.
Committee members are responsible for universities and trainers authorization. They
also take care of courses content validation and launch targeted surveys to maintain the
overall quality of the delivered services.

4. Enrollments
As we said earlier, anyone can join the platform as a Learner. He must at least provide an
email and a password so that he can be identified by the platform. Later, he will be
asked for further information including a profile picture.
A Trainer, however, while going through the same process as the Learner in the
beginning, will be asked for a resume and wait for demand to be validated. In other
words, everyone can apply for a Trainer membership in the platform and they will be
given access to a space where they can follow their membership status. But only those
whose applications are accepted by the committee members will be authorized to
operate as trainers.
The platform signs contracts with universities and this is always done out of the
platform. The Admin then registers an account for the university which will be used by
the latter to designate their trusted trainers which will be later contacted by the platform
via email and membership will be granted for them automatically.
The committee must at least have 3 permanent members. Their accounts are created
and activated by the platform administrator. Trainers with a certain standing can enrich
the committee. Such a decision has to be voted by committee members. The Admin is
then notified and thereafter grants required privileges to the Trainer.

5. Surveys, Quizzes and Exam edition
Multiple choice questions are the foundation of traditional surveying. They allow the
respondent to choose one or multiple options from a list of possible answers. When it
comes to the platform that we want to build, this technique is not only used for surveys
but also for quizzes and exams. The questions may be accompanied with pictures and
code snippets in the case of exams and quizzes.
The need for an easy to use generic tool to generate multiple choice questions is an
undeniable fact as it will be used by committee members and trainers. It must be
seamlessly embedded within the platform.
Lately, quizzes/exams and surveys will be answered by targeted audience and their
results are to be stored for further analysis.

6. Course submission
First of all, the Trainer submits the course’s idea supported by a short descriptive video
and a meaningful poster. He also sets the course under a particular topic (ex: Server side
development) and tags it with keywords in order to enable efficient and even faceted
search hereafter. Then he sets prerequisites and learning outcomes.
The course’s idea is submitted for first approval by the committee. If only one member
approves the idea, the course accepted for edition. The Trainer who submitted the
course then gets notified of the result.
Editing a course consists in setting its chapters and associating each one of them with
learning outcomes. The Trainer is required to associate with each one of these
educational recourses consisting at least of a presentation and a video lecture where he
goes through its content. It is highly recommended to include a quiz to check learners’
understanding. However, a final exam has to conclude the course.
It is possible for the course editor to attach a badge with a chapter so that it can be
gained by learners if their score is height enough. By the way, considered as trophies,
achievement certifications and badges adorn the Learner’s profile.
Once edited, the course is submitted for final validation and same rules apply as for its
idea validation.

7. Interactivity
The interaction between learner and trainer happens by means of live chat and
discussion in course group. The Trainer schedules live chat sessions with its followers at
its convenience. Learners get notified of scheduled sessions and express their will to
participate. In the course discussion group, it is always possible for a learner to post a
topic that may be a question or whatever. Other learners and even the Trainer can take
part in this discussion. In addition, learners can post comments and rate on course
resources: video lectures and reading materials.
Besides notifications, all interactions between trainers and committee members is done
via emails.
